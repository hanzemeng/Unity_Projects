The gate... it's getting wider!
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Elder_Dendrius_Portrait
Exactly! Dendrius was stupid to think he could keep this from me.
Left NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Elder_Dendrius_Portrait
Wait... what? Are you...
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Elder_Dendrius_Portrait
Yes, I'm not your grandfather, you silly boy.
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
I'm Axorath, his twin brother.
Left NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
But how did you...
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
Ah, remember the story I've told you? When my brother and I discovered the magical portal?
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
As we stepped into the portal, we began to witness the true source of the power and hear those sweet voices...
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
For me, they were music to my ears. Songs of infinite power and limitless life.
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
But my brother Dendrius was revulsed by them. He saw it all as a dark plague that would destroy - instead of transform - humanity. He was wrong.
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
Ecstatic with this new-found power, I immediately set forth to transforming the world.
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
Sure, people died, but in a world clouded by chaos and strife, sacrifices have to be made.
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
But Dendrius, the fool, tried to stop me by sealing the portal with the Synapse Stone...
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
So I killed him. But not before he had sealed the portal.
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
I was now powerless, as weak as a newborn with all magic having been wrenched from my being.
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
In his dying breath, Dendrius summoned his faithful servant Navi, the only witness to the events...
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
Dendrius told him to hide the Synapse Stone in the Swamp of Bandoin where I could not get it because of the darkness in my heart...
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
He told him to leave immediately, lest I recover my strength and take it from him.
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
And he told him not to talk to anyone, for Dendrius knew my neuromancy power could turn any friend into foe.
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
Little did Dendrius know I had no power left. I could not stop Navi.
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
I was done for. I could hear the angry voices of men coming to get me. My end was near.
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
But then... an idea!
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
I swapped my clothes with those of Dendrius and assumed his identity.
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
I hid his body and made up a story to tell the guards...
Left NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
The same story you told me!
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
Exactly!
Left NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
But what happened with Navi? Why did he never tell anyone what happened?
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
Once I regained my strength, I went after him and made sure he never told anyone anything.
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
But Iâ€™ve been trying to get Synapse Stone ever since. Until you brought it to me.
Right NormalTextBubble_V2 Hero_Portrait Axorath_Portrait
And now, I can go back and imbibe the sweet infinite power!
